- 👋 Hi, I’m @KonstantinosRekoumis
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science and its applications in Naval Architecture 🛳 and Mechanical-Marine Engineering ⚙ (maybe Game Development too  🤷)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Naval Architecture and Marine Enginneering at the National Technical University of Athens. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that grabs my interest ranging from Scientific applications to creating goofy videogames 
- 🤖 I'm currently working on the use of Neural Networks and how they can be applied in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics, to speed up the designing and optimization of Airfoils.
