- 👋 Hi, I’m @KonstantinosRekoumis
- 🛳 I am Naval Architect - Marine Engineer with a keen interest in Computer Science
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science and its applications in Naval Architecture 🛳 and Mechanical-Marine Engineering ⚙ (maybe Game Development too  🤷)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Computational Physics (FEM - CFD), to automate everything with python or bash, and ~~how one can make Source Lisp Turing Complete (👀)~~. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that grabs my interest ranging from Scientific applications to creating goofy videogames 
- 🤖 I'm currently working on my PhD in Computational Fluid Dynamics, where I study the development of a strongly coupled Hydroelasticity solver, using high fidelity CFD.
- ✅ Main pieces of work: 

    1 - CNN algorithms predicting flow over airfoils, where Neural Networks are applied in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics, to speed up the designing and optimization of Airfoils
    
    2 - Rule based design tool for calculating a cargo ship's Mid Section according to IACS Common Structural Rules (2022)
