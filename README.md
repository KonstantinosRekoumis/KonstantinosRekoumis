- 👋 Hi, I’m @KonstantinosRekoumis
- 🛳 I am Naval Architect - Marine Engineer with a keen interest in Computer Science
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science and its applications in Naval Architecture 🛳 and Mechanical-Marine Engineering ⚙ (maybe Game Development too  🤷)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Computational Physics (FEM - CFD) and how one can make Source Lisp Turing Complete (👀). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that grabs my interest ranging from Scientific applications to creating goofy videogames 
- 🤖 I'm currently working on the use of Neural Networks and how they can be applied in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics, to speed up the designing and optimization of Airfoils.
- ✅ Main pieces of work: 

    1 - CNN algorithms predicting flow over airfoils
    
    2 - Rule based design tool for calculating a cargo ship's Mid Section according to IACS Common Structural Rules (2022)
